These are the raw data used to generate the clean data. 

The raw data for bacteria, fungi, and nematodes, are .fastq files from metabarcoding. They and are processed using DADA2, and the fungi are also processed using vsearch and lulu. The processing pipeline is available in "bioinformatic_processing_of_bacteria_fungi_and_nematodes.Rmd". 

The raw malaise trap data is a data frame generated by phyloseq::psmelt(). These data are also from metabarcoding, performed by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA). The plant and insects datasets have been manually entered in excel-sheets. The processing pipeline is available in "cleaning_pitfall_malaise_and_plant_data.Rmd".
